# # Intelligent Issue Insight Engine (PS-14)

This project is built as part of PS-14: Intelligent Issue Insight Engine.

The system converts unstructured user-written complaints into structured insights such as issue category, priority level, and recurring trends. It uses Edge AI for on-device inference and a web application to visualize results and analytics.

## Problem Statement

In colleges and organizations, complaints are usually written in free-text format. These complaints are manually read, categorized, and prioritized, which is time-consuming and error-prone. Urgent issues may get delayed and recurring problems are hard to track.

This project aims to automate issue categorization, priority prediction, and insight generation.

## Solution Overview

The Intelligent Issue Insight Engine automatically analyzes complaint text and:
- Classifies issues into categories
- Predicts priority (Low / Medium / High)
- Identifies recurring patterns and trends

The ML model is trained using Edge Impulse and deployed on an Android phone as an edge device. A web application displays the results and analytics.
